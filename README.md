# FreeCodeCamp Projects 

This repo is where I keep track of my Python work as I go through freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python path. Each project helps me practice key programming concepts like algorithms, recursion, data structures, and more.

## ✅ Curriculum Topics

You will learn and apply:

* Python syntax and semantics  
* Data types and data structures  
* Loops and conditionals  
* Functions and modules  
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
* Algorithms and recursion  
* Regular Expressions  
* CLI tools
