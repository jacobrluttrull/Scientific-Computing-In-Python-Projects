# FreeCodeCamp Projects üêç

This repo is where I keep track of my Python work as I go through the freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python path. Each code piece adds to big ideas in programming in small, easy bits. Be it algorithms, CLI tools, or managing data, these tasks help me build up my skills in Python.
