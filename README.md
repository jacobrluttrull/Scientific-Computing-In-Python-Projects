# FreeCodeCamp Projects üêç

This repo is where I keep track of my Python work as I go through freeCodeCamp's **Scientific Computing with Python** certification. Each code piece builds on core programming concepts in approachable, hands-on steps. Whether it's algorithms, CLI tools, or string manipulation with regex, these mini-projects help me grow my Python skills consistently.
