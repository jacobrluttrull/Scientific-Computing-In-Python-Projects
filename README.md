# FreeCodeCamp Projects 🐍

This repo serves as my Python project journal as I progress through freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python track. Each script builds on key programming concepts in a bite-sized, digestible way. Whether it’s algorithms, CLI tools, or data handling, these projects are building blocks for my Python journey.
